Day1:OOP Concept
Object oriented programming:
  It is a programming paradigm where dealing everything in terms of classes and objects. It helps to organize the code better and
  allow us to reuse the code. 
1.Class
  Class is a blueprint or template used to create an object. It contains properties and methods.
      Eg: class Shape{
              int hight;
              int width;
              Shape(int h,int w){
                this.hight=h;
                this.width=w;
              }
              void display(){...}
          }

2.Object 
  Object is an instance of a class. It is a real world entity. Whenever an object is created, memory space is allocated for that object.
      Eg: Shape obj=new Shape(4,5);

3.Polymorphism
  Polymorphism means having many form. In OOP, object can act differently on different context. There are two types of Polymorphism.
        1. Compile time/Static Polymorphism - resolved at compile time. Eg:Function overloading.
        2. Run time/Dynamic Polymorphism -resolved at run time. Eg:Function overriding.

4.Abstraction:
  Showing only essential details to the user and hiding the implementation complexity from the user. It cen be done with abstract class or interface. Design level issue.

5.Encapsulation:
  Wrapping up the data and methods under a single unit called class and providing security through Access modifiers. Implementation level issue.

6.Inheritance:
  Creating a new class from an existing class so that it inherits the features of the parent class. It allows the programmers to reuse the code. There are different
  types of Inheritance. 1.Single Inheritance, 2.Multiple Inheritance, 3.Multilevel Inheritance, 4.Hierarchical Inheritance, 5.Hybrid Inheritance.
